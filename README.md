# Node-Expressgen 🚀

At my job, whenever i was working on writting backend APIs, i used to find myself copy-pasting the same directory and file strucutres over and over again. So, i created this simple node express boilerplate generator to ease the task. I acknowledge, there are so many better and adavanced tools for this task, but i wanted to build something custom while learning something new :)

PS: This project is still in beta,  please feel free to open a issue or pull request for any kind of feature suggestion, feedback, improvement.
## Installation

Install node-expressgen with npm globally

```bash
  npm install node-expressgen -g
```
    
## Usage/Examples

Once you installed it globally, just type this command where you want to generate the boilerplate.

```bash
expressgen

```
It will prompt a question, asking you for project name.

```bash
? Project name: <Enter your project name here>
```

And boom!! you have your node express boilerplate
